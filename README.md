# Static Comp Challenge 2
---
**Project description**: For this static comp we were challenged to recreate a fully responsive site which included multiple media queries. 
This site had to be responsive to as low as 320 pixels wide. We were expected to reflect every small detail from the comp example including 
spacing, layout, and utilzing a good choice of color palette and photos/icons.
